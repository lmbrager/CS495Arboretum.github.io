<h1>Arboretum app</h1>
<p>The main page of the website should give a concise definition of the project goals. At
the end of the semester, it may be appropriate to place the video either at the bottom
of this description, or on a separate page.
2. A link to a subpage of project deliverables should be provided. This page should
contain all of the presentations, delivered documents, source code, and a link to the
final .apk file for your app.
3. A link to a separate page should be provided that provides a bio of all the team
members, to whatever detail the team feels comfortable providing (photo, bio,
contact, etc).</p>

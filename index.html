  The <a href="https://arboretum.ua.edu/">UA Arboretum</a> is a 60-acre property sponsored by the Department of Biological Sciences 
  in the College of Arts & Sciences. The property focuses on education, research, and service. It is the motivation for the Toureum app
  as many public lands face problems with staffing and funding for full guided tour programs. A free, public use app would allow public lands
  to provide guided tours by uploading points of interest in tours so they can be viewed at later points. </br>
 
</br><h2>Project Goals</h2></br>  
Toureum aims to provide intuitive creation and taking of tours. Each tour consists of points of interest and is associated with a
location.</brbr>
  
</br><h3>Accounts</h3>
Toureum accounts are created by either users or managers. Managers can apply to become approved. Toureum makes accounts easy
with features like account recovery, account verification, and the ability to update options. </br>

</br><h3>Users</h3>
Non-manager users of the app can access numerous functionalities. Primarily, they are able to use "explore mode" to pan through nearby
locations. Once users find an interesting location, they can look at details or look at its tours. If any tour is of particular interest to them, they can "favorite" it, or "unfavorite" it once they are done. Users can make their own tours for locations too! Once they complete the tour-making process, 
they are able to submit the tour to the manager for review. </br>

</br><h3>Managers</h3>
Manager users can manage location profiles, updating the location's images or other information. They can also manage the location's available tours, pooled 
from their tours and community tours. Otherwise, they have all the capabilities of normal users. </br>

</br><h3>Functionality</h3>
Firebase Firestore was implemented as the database for Toureum. Firebase was also used for user authentication. These functionalities allow for 
safety and privacy for app users.</br>
Google Maps API was used to implement many features throughout the app. Creating, updating, and deleting the app's features - tours, locations, and 
points - are made more intuitive as map attributes can be easily manipulated.</br>

</br><h3>Future Goals</h3>
The team is working to make the app available for use by the UA Arboretum. However, due to COVID-19, the Arboretum remains closed, which has hindered
close development with them. However, we hope to implement these features in the future to improve the app.</br>
